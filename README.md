## üîç Overview

This app allows users to input various job attributes and returns a predicted salary using a trained ensemble model built with Scikit-learn. It's designed for educational, prototyping, or hiring insights.

## üß† Machine Learning Techniques Used

The application uses an **ensemble learning approach** called a **Voting Regressor**, which combines predictions from the following models:

1. **Linear Regression**  
   A baseline model that assumes a linear relationship between features and salary.

2. **Random Forest Regressor**  
   A powerful ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy by averaging many models trained on random data samples.

3. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**  
   An advanced boosting technique that builds models sequentially to reduce prediction error.

These models are combined to improve generalization and prediction performance.

## üéõÔ∏è Input Parameters

The user selects or provides values for the following:

| Input Field         | Type     | Description                                                  |
|---------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Job Title`         | Dropdown | Example: Machine Learning Scientist, Data Analyst, etc.      |
| `Company Size`      | Dropdown | Company size: Small (`S`), Medium (`M`), Large (`L`)         |
| `Employee Residence`| Dropdown | Country/region of the employee (e.g., US, GB, IN, etc.)      |
| `Experience Level`  | Dropdown | Entry (`EN`), Mid (`MI`), Senior (`SE`), Executive (`EX`)     |
| `Employment Type`   | Dropdown | Full-time (`FT`), Part-time (`PT`), Freelance (`FL`), Contract (`CT`) |

These values are dynamically loaded from the dataset (`dropdown_options.pkl`).
